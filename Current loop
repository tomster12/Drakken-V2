//    MAIN GAME LOOP FOR PLAYING

||update score|| update local and foreign copies of score

//lock turn// lock the turn variable
//officially lock turn// send turn lock to server

- when using a showToken
- decide whether it will complete turn
- this factors in partial tokens and extraToken
- lock the token and //lock turn// if complete

- use the tokens action with callback
- pass in complete, token and showToken
- the action can affect params
- the action can use ||update score||

  - callback will call animateOffscreen
  - pass in previous params and another callback

    - callback will //officially lock turn//
    - callback will ||update score||

  - if token affects enemy tell enemy to call
    foreign action for token
  - dont pass showToken over as it breaks

    - gameScreen receives foreign token request
    - calls the foreignAction for the token
    - this action can affect params
    - this action can use ||update score||
    - pass in params from network
    - ||update score||
